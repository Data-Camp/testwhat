The `testwhat` package provides rich functionality to write Submission Correctness Tests for interactive R exercises on the DataCamp platform. The package is a wrapper around [Hadley Wickham's `testthat` package](https://github.com/hadley/testthat), the standard for unit testing in R.

For a detailed guide on how to use `testwhat`, head over to the [wiki](https://github.com/datacamp/testwhat/wiki).
