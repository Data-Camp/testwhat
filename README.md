## Testwhat

Welcome to the repository of the __testwhat__ package, an extension to Hadley's testthat package. 
This package allows you to design Submission Correctness Tests for interactive exercises on DataCamp.

More details concerning course creation can be found in the [datacamp package](https://github.com/Data-Camp/datacamp).

For a more detailed course creation guide, send a request to [teach@datacamp.com](teach@datacamp.com) and we will respond asap.
