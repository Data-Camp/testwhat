#' Run all tests for an exercise
#'
#' Run all tests for an exercise and report the results (including feedback).
#' This function is run by R Backend and should not be used by course creators.
#'
#' @param sct Submission correctness tests as a character string.
#' @param ex_type Type of the exercise
#' @param pec pre-exercise-code
#' @param student_code character string representing the student code
#' @param solution_code character string representing the solution code
#' @param student_env environment containing the objects defined by the student.
#' @param solution_env environment containing the objects defined by solution code
#' @param output_list the output structure that is generated by RBackend
#' @param in_test_mode whether or not the system is in 'content testing mode'. 
#' If this is the case, e.g. \code{\link{test_or}} will behave differently.
#'
#' @return A list with components \code{passed} that indicates whether all
#' tests were sucessful, and \code{feedback} that contains a feedback message.
