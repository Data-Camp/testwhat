## Search for pattern in output

`check_output()` enables you to check for patterns or literal matches in the output the student generated with his or her submission. Where `check_output_expr()` (see next section) _executes_ the `expr` argument you pass it and then tries to match it to the student's output, the `check_output()` function doesn't perform any execution: it simply looks for matches for the `pattern` you specify.

### Example

Suppose you want to check whether the student printed out `My name is <name here>`. A solution could look like this:

```{r}
# Print out your name
"My name is DataCamp"
```

To allow for different names here, you can use the following SCT:

```{r}
ex() %>% check_output("[M|m]y name is [a-zA-Z]+?", missing_msg = "Have you printed out your name?")
```

The regex allows you to allow both `my` and `My`, and to allow any name, as long as its first character is a letter and there's at least one such character.

## Search if student output contains output of expression

`check_output_expr()` executes the `expr` - an R expression as a string that you specify - and records the output it generates. Next, it tries to match this output to the output that the student generated with his or her submission. With `times` you can specify how often this match should occur, and with `incorrect_msg` you can override the automatically generated message in case the test failed.

**`check_output_expr()` is used very often, typically to check if the student correctly printed out a variable, whatever its class**. It is also pretty robust to different solutions: how people end up printing the variable doesn't matter, as long as the output contains the correct info it's all good.

**WATCH OUT:** `check_output_expr()` is only appropriate to test _textual output_, so actual printouts to the console. It will not work to test function calls that do not generate any output, or that generate plot output. Using, for example, `test_output_contains("hist(mtcars$mpg)")` to test whether a student correctly created a histogram of the `mpg` column of `mtcars` makes no sense: the `hist()` function does not generate textual output that can be captured with `capture.output()`.

### Example

Suppose you want the student to print out the fourth row of the `mtcars` data frame. The solution would look as follows:

```{r}
# Print out the fourth row of mtcars
mtcars[4, ]
```

The following SCT would check this:

```{r}
ex() %>% check_output_expr("mtcars[4, ]", missing_msg = "Have you used `[4, ]` to print out the fourth row of `mtcars`?")
```

You simply pass the expression that would generate the correct printout as an expression, and `check_output_expr()` takes care of the rest. You can also use a custom `missing_msg` to give meaningful feedback to the student.
