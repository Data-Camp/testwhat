\title{Test whether a student correctly used an inline operator}
\usage{
test_operator(name, index = 1, eval = TRUE, eq_condition = "equivalent",
  not_called_msg = NULL, incorrect_msg = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{Name of the operator as a string, e.g. \code{"+"}}

\item{index}{integer that specifies which \code{name} operator that will be
checked in the solution}

\item{eval}{whether or not to evaluate the expression that is formed by the
operator}

\item{eq_condition}{How results of expression evaluations are compared. See
\code{\link{test_object}}}

\item{not_called_msg}{custom feedback message in case the student did not
call the operator often enough.}

\item{incorrect_msg}{custom feedback message in case the student's evaluation
of the expression that is formed by the operator does not correspond with
the corresponding call in the solution}
